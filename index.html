                    Our intention is to share remembrance of the wonderful play of divinity in the world and in our
                    very lives as celebrated in the ancient traditions of Braj and Bhagavat Purana, wherein the
                    Divine Person became, played in and with Their own creation.

                    What happens in Vrindavan at night? The forests and kunjas of this place, are compared to our
                    own hearts. This makes sense, and is a good meditation to consider God residing in the hearts of
                    His own creation.

                    The soul, or jeev, is always searching. It is described in Bhagavad Gita that the jeev has been
                    on such a journey for a very long time. This is described as chaurasi lac yoni. That the soul
                    is wandering through 84,000 different types of births and forms of life. To end up searching for
                    this place, to become a Braj upasak, one who meditates upon this place and the activities
                    here, has perfected their birth.

                    The gopis of Braj Dham are considered to be the top yogis in their perfection of always
                    meditating and serving God with their full being. This perfection is known as sarvatma bhav,
                    to see Divinity everywhere
                </p>
